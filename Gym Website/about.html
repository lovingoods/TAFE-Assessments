        <h2>About the owner and his philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I
          competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my
          knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump
          into the ring as your sparring partner. For over three decades Maurice
          has been involved in the boxing scene. He has competed as an amateur
          in his early years and now shares his knowledge and expertise as a
          coach, by running his boxing classes with passion and enthusiasm. The
          atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly
          energised. Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate
          level boxer, you will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of
          the best cardiovascular workouts available.
